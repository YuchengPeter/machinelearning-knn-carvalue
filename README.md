# machinelearning-knn-carvalue
Using knn to predict car value

All data originates from UCI Machine Learning Repository's Car Evaluation http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation

I am writing this code to practice my knowledge of knn

Currently I am not using cross validation to find the optimal value of K(using training data for simplicity); the accuracy rate is extremely low(around 24%) with the current selected attributes to predict car value. Therefore, I am working on finding the best attributes for this prediction.
